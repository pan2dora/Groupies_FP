## Getting Giphy API Key

To use the Giphy API in Groupies, you need to obtain an API key from the Giphy Developer Portal. Here's how you can get your own API key:

 - [ ] Visit the [Giphy Developer Portal](https://developers.giphy.com/)
       in your web browser.
       
 
 - [ ]   If you don't already have an account, click on the "Create an Account" button and follow the instructions to sign up for a new
              account. If you have an account, simply log in.

       
        

 - [ ] Once you're logged in, navigate to the "Create an App" page.
              
         
 - [ ] Fill out the required information for your app, including the app name, description, and other relevant details.
       These details
              will help Giphy understand your use case.

    

 - [ ] Accept the terms and conditions, and click on the "Create App" button to create your app.
              
           
 - [ ] After your app is created, you'll be redirected to the app's dashboard. Here, you'll find your unique API key under the
       "API
              Keys" section. Copy this API key.

   

 - [ ]  Open the Groupies application and locate the configuration file where the Giphy API key is used. It could be a file named
              `config.js`, `constants.js`, or similar.
              
     
 - [ ] In the configuration file, find the place where the Giphy API key
       is expected and replace the existing value with the API key
       you copied from the Giphy Developer Portal.
                     
         
 - [ ]  Save the changes to the configuration file.

    

Once you have completed these steps, the Groupies application will be able to use your Giphy API key to fetch and display animated GIFs.

Note: Keep your API key secure and avoid sharing it publicly. If you suspect your key has been compromised, you can regenerate a new key in the Giphy Developer Portal.

That's it! You now have your own Giphy API key and you're ready to use it in Groupies. Enjoy sharing animated GIFs with the community! ðŸŽ‰
